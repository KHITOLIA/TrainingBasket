{"1": "Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) \nthat uses algorithms to enable computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.", "2": "\nBy analyzing large datasets, ML models identify patterns, make predictions, and \nimprove their performance over time through a process called training.", "3": " The goal of ML is \"generalization,\" where a trained model applies\nits learned patterns to new, \nunseen data to perform tasks like forecasting, classification, and \ngenerating content."}
